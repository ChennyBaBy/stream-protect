#### This plugin is born from the fear of showing something sensitive while i'm live streaming.

After installing this plugin go to it's settings, you can add your own filenames of the file you would like this plugin to pick up, when you try to open these sensitive files it will prompt you asking if you are sure you want to read this file right now. if you said no.

I need your help! I'm gathering a list of common files that are sensitive so i can add it to the default values to watch out for in this plugin.

## TODOs

### MVP
- [x] get event on opening file
- [x] check filename match
- [x] matching against a list from stored settings
- [x] don't show original file content

### Roadmap
- [ ] panel to cover original file content
- [ ] confirm button to reveal
- [ ] Check if user is streaming
- [ ] Doesn't check file when user not streaming

## To fix
- [ ] check existing opened files aren't sensitive as well
