#### This plugin is born from the fear of showing something sensitive while i'm live streaming.

After installing this plugin go to it's settings, you can add your own filenames of the file you would like this plugin to pick up, when you try to open these sensitive files it will prompt you asking if you are sure you want to read this file right now. if you said no.

#### I need your help! I'm gathering a list of common files that are sensitive so I can add it to the default files to watch out for in this plugin. If you have any suggestions on what to add please let me know here.

## TODOs

### MVP
- [x] get event on opening file
- [x] check filename match
- [x] matching against a list from stored settings
- [x] don't show original file content

### Roadmap
- [ ] panel to cover original file content
- [ ] confirm button to reveal
- [ ] Check if user is streaming
- [ ] Doesn't check file when user not streaming

## To fix
